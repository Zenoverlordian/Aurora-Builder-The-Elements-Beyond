        <description>
            <p>Fire keepers are wardens tasked with protecting cities and the vital wilderness from wildfires and uncontrolled blazes. They harness the power of fire to extinguish or curtail large conflagrations, but they also use controlled flames to clear away dangerous tinder and punish those arsonists they manage to catch. Unlike druids of flame, fire keepers hold no reverence for fire elementals, regarding them only as wildfires; they must be controlled or put down if released into the Material Plane.</p>
